# PumpPoster #

PumpPoster posts a variety of activities to accounts on Pump.io servers.


### Code ###

A working installation of Ruby version 2 is required (the latest known
working version is shown in the `.rvmrc` file), and either:

* install Bundler and run `bundle install`, or
* manually install the Rubygems listed in the Gemfile.

The first time PumpPoster is run -- via `pump_poster.rb` -- the site,
username and password must be supplied:
  pump_poster.rb -s https://mysite.com -u johndoe -p pass123

Once authenticated, these arguments need not be given because tokens
will be stored locally. A menu system will present the activities
and guide through any configuration or options. Direct invocation is
also possible for some/all activities.

Try using `--help` for more invocation information.

NOTE: to use external services, you may be required to supply your
existing username for those sites. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME_HERE` in the
`lib/pump/menu.rb` file accordingly.

As the software is currently in an early version, it may break. There
is not much/any/enough handling of, for example, network errors or
invalid data received from external feeds. If you encounter any errors
due to bugs in the code, please create a bug at the website.
